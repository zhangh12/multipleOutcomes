Description: Regression models can be fitted for multiple outcomes simultaneously. This package computes estimates of parameters across fitted models and returns the matrix of asymptotic covariance. Various applications of this package, including CUPED (Controlled Experiments Utilizing Pre-Experiment Data), multiple comparison adjustment, are illustrated.
